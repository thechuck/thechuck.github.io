        <h1>HTML Elements<h1>
      </header>
        <p>There are a lot of html elements and knowing which one is right to use can be tricky.  You can build an entire website out of &lt;div&gt; elements and it will look great
          but it will not be the best when it comes to search engine optimization or screen readers for the visually impaired.  To that end I have made this page to discuss not only what
          certain HTML elements mean but also when they should be used. </p>

              <h2>The basic elements</h2>
                <p>  There are a lot of HTML elements and most develoeprs never commit them all to memory.  This group of basic elements are the ones used in almost every website and will be the ones
                  you encounter most frequently as a developer.</p>
                  <section>
                  <h3>&lt;h1&gt; and other header elements</h3>
                  <p> The &lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt; elements are used to title sections of your page.  It typically changes the font size of the enclosed text to indicte that it is a header for what follows on the page.
                     They have a decreasing order of importance as the number in the element tag increases.  For example on this page "HTML Elements" at the top is the main heading.  It tells you what to expect from the content for the entire page and so it uses an &lt;h1&gt; element.  Further down the page you see
                    "The basic elements" is a new section but since it falls within the HTML Elements section it has a lower heading rank so it uses an &lt;h2&gt; element.  Finally the begining of this section on the header elements uses an &lt;h3&gt; element because it falls within the section titled the basic elements</p>

                  <h3>&lt;p&gt; The paragraph element</h3>
                  <p>The &lt;p&gt; tag is used to indicate a contained block of text.  By default it has spacing above and below the line and will put all elements within the tags in their own block on the page.  As its name implies the paragraph tag is meand to suround block of text that </p>
