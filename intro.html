        <p>Hello,  I'm Chuck. </p>
        <p>I am a full stack developer.</p>
        <p>I enjoy making fun sites, games, and playing with AI.  This site is meant to showcase some examples of my work and teach others about the my interests.</p>
        <p>I also have a section where I will go over some of the basics for creating web applications. I hope some people will find them helpful in their journey as developers. </p>
